## Usage
If you own a cab or controller and just want to play the game, follow the instructions below:

2. Go to [aquadx.net](https://aquadx.net) and make an account.
3. Click on "Setup Connection" in the home page, and follow the instructions.
4. Play a coin with your card.  
   (Either a physical card or the `aime.txt` / `felica.txt` in your segatools)
5. Pet your cat 🐱
6. Link your card on the website. 

If you encounter any issue, please report in the [issue tracker](https://MewoLab/AquaDX/issues).
